To Train:
run "python model1StreamedAxolotl.py"
run "python -m axolotl.cli.train axolotl.yaml"

To Run:
Go in model1StreamedTest.py go to MODEL_ID and change it to the location of the trained lora adapters
run "python model1StreamedTest.py"

Notes:
Is able to train on 2048 sequence_len in axolotl.yaml on lab machines however it drops many files due to size exceeding sequence_len.

Some Todos:
Update it to use new prompt from model-1-prompt brnach
Test trained model output on higher sequences and using runpod (on 2k sequence_len max input its very bad)
eg sequence_len of 32k+
