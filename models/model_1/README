To Train:
python model1StreamedAxolotl.py
python -m axolotl.cli.train axolotl.yaml

To Run:
Go in model1StreamedTest.py go to MODEL_ID and change it to the location of the trained lora adapters.

Notes:
Is able to train on 2048 sequence_len in axolotl.yaml on lab machines however it drops many files due to size exceeding sequence_len

Some Todos:
Update it to use new prompt
Test trained model output (on 2k sequence_len max input its very bad)
check if is trainable with longer sequence_len eg 32k+
